The Fool holds a rose in one hand, and the other hand carries their worldly possessions wrapped in a bindle. A white dog jumps at their feet, ready to serve as a loyal companion for the journey ahead.",

      "meaning_up": "You’re standing on the precipice of something great. It can be scary to take risks, but you’ll never know what could have been if you don’t take that leap into the unknown. Be open to new opportunities and take a moment to set clear intentions before diving in. What do you hope to get out of this? How can you prioritize joy along the way? Don’t worry about finding the perfect approach. If you end up making a mistake, turn it into a learning opportunity and don’t let it discourage you from continuing on your journey. Try something new, no matter how small, and see where it leads you.",

Are you ignoring advice because you (subconsciously) don’t want to be talked out of something? Are you afraid of failure or of being seen as “foolish” by others? Take time to connect with your inner child. What does that inner child need to feel safe and confident enough to take a risk? What can they teach you about pursuing joy and freeing yourself of “adult” concerns?"

In The Magician's right hand is a wand raised toward heaven, while their left hand points to the earth. This pose represents the adage “As Above, So Below,” indicating that The Magician is ready to be a conduit between the spiritual and physical realms. On the table in front of The Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits, suggesting they have all the strengths afforded by the suits at their disposal. Beneath the altar are roses and lilies.

      "meaning_up": "You have limitless capabilities, and if you focus your efforts properly, you can create something unique and incredible. Like The Magician, you have all the tools you need at your fingertips and are excited to move forward. First, you need a clear plan of action. Focus on the “why” just as much as the “what.” Remembering why you want something is a helpful motivator. Ask yourself: if you could have or do anything, what would it be and why? Are there steps you can take toward manifesting it?",
      "meaning_rev": "You feel like you haven’t been given a chance to shine. While external validation is nice, it’s more important to be in alignment with your higher self. Consider the “why” as well as the “what.” When you pursue a path for the wrong reason, it’s hard to find joy in what you do. Remember that The Magician is someone who takes action rather than expecting things to happen for them. Don’t wait for some divine force to act on your behalf— you are that force! If an obstacle stands in your way, you have the resources to find your way around (or through) that obstacle."

      "meaning_up": "It takes practice to quiet the critical, analytical part of your mind and tap into your intuition, but it’s worth the effort. That’s not to say you can’t factor in logical reasoning; just make sure your intuition has a seat at the table. Just as The High Priestess hangs a veil between the physical and spiritual realms, you are encouraged to set boundaries around engaging with the subconscious. This is especially relevant when others ask you to hold space for their feelings and traumas. Engaging with spirituality opens up pathways that can feel uncomfortable, but being uncomfortable isn’t always a bad thing.",
      "meaning_rev": "You’re feeling out of touch with your intuition. Are you stifling or ignoring a gut feeling because you can’t logically explain it? Are you allowing yourself to be influenced by others, clouding your view of what you want and what you think is right? What is blocking you from fully trusting yourself? Where is there a sense of imbalance in your life? It may feel uncomfortable to ask yourself these questions, so go as slowly as you need to. Be gentle with yourself. Honor the parts of you that are fearful, traumatized, or raw, and ask what you can do to support your healing process."

      "meaning_up": "The Empress reminds you to take a moment to care for yourself. Connect with your senses, spend time in nature, and reflect on the abundance that surrounds you. Remember that self-care does not have to take the form of expensive purchases; you can light your favorite candle, bring a book to the park, put a fresh set of sheets on your bed, or take a leisurely bath. Traditional interpretations of The Empress refer to a mother figure. Motherhood can take many forms and is not limited to any one gender. How do you care for others, and how do your loved ones care for you?",
      "meaning_rev": "Motherhood can (and should) involve mothering yourself, regardless of whether you have children. Ensure your physical, spiritual, and emotional needs are met. If you are feeling stifled in any way, consider your relationships. Have you become overly dependent on someone, or made someone dependent on you? It may be time to create space between you and that person. Rather than a person, there may be a project or responsibility that is taking up too much space in your mind, leaving no time or energy for things that bring you joy. Focus on your relationship with yourself— engage your senses and nurture your creativity. Remember not to neglect yourself when you show up for others."

They sit atop a stark, barren mountain, a sign of sterility, regulation, and unyielding power.",
      "numerology": "4: Structure, foundations, stability",
      "meaning_up": "The Emperor is often seen as an enforcer, but they are also a protector. The Emperor takes a methodical, structured approach to leadership and problem-solving. They know that leadership does not require maintaining control over others, and that power must be used responsibly and benevolently. If you have privilege afforded to you by patriarchy, institutional racism, or other systems of oppression, consider how you can use your power to dismantle those systems and lift up affected individuals. Less privileged folks are encouraged to channel The Emperor’s “protector” role, whether that means protecting fellow community members, themselves, or their inner child.",
      "meaning_rev": "When you’re feeling vulnerable or disenfranchised, The Emperor reminds you to speak up for yourself. Standing up to authority isn’t always easy and can even be dangerous for some people, so make an assessment of your own safety and act accordingly. It’s also worth considering whether you are the one abusing power. Is a rigid worldview or bias holding you back? Remember that power is not a zero-sum game. You can exercise your leadership skills while nurturing the same in others. If you are feeling hesitant to take a leadership position, ask yourself what’s holding you back. Draw strength from The Emperor and harness your inner power."

Two monks wait at The Hierophant’s feet to receive their spiritual wisdom. The crossed keys lying within reach represent access to sacred knowledge and the spiritual realm.

The Hierophant represents the spiritual (not necessarily religious) teachings and beliefs that are passed down through generations. They remind us to take stock of those beliefs, keep what serves us, and let go of the rest. Form your own code of ethics and act accordingly while considering the example you are setting for others.",
      "meaning_rev": "Consider your current circumstances (your job, friendships, romantic relationships, familial ties and responsibilities, etc.) and ask yourself whether they reflect your values. If you’re not clear on what those values are, dedicate some time to figuring it out. You might turn to a mentor or trusted elder for advice, but remember that you are the expert on your life. Live authentically rather than seeking external validation. You can honor your ancestors while forging your own path— doing what is right for you is not a betrayal of your family or your community."

      "meaning_up": "The Lovers is commonly associated with relationships, but it can also represent a major decision that lies ahead. Relationships, however, are a kind of decision: love of any kind must be consciously created and nurtured rather than treated as something that will “just happen” and then sustain itself. Like relationships, decision-making should come from a place of intentionality, honesty (with yourself and others!), and accountability. Listen to your values and desires rather than what you think you “should” want or believe. Take time to give the situation the consideration it deserves.",
      "meaning_rev": "You may feel like you’re being pulled in opposite directions— forced to choose between your head and your heart, your career or your family, or perhaps a romantic relationship is pulling time and focus away from your friendships. The Lovers in reverse is a reminder to restore balance to all aspects of your life. Ensure there is equal give and take in your relationships, and remember to cultivate your relationship with yourself. Show compassion to yourself, even the parts that make you feel uneasy or ashamed. Our perceived shortcomings are often coping mechanisms for needs that have gone unmet. How can you move toward getting those needs met?"

      "meaning_up": "The Chariot represents a strong will to succeed combined with the discipline and commitment necessary for achieving success. It is not enough to want something; you need to move toward your goals. If your chariot is made of stone, you may not be able to move as fast as you’d like, but that slowness gives you a chance to focus on your next move so you can be sure it’s the right one. Have faith in yourself, stand up for what you believe in, and you’ll triumph over any obstacles that get in your way.",
      "meaning_rev": "Are you worried that you’re going down the wrong path? It’s not too late to reevaluate and change course. Admitting you were wrong can be hard, but don’t push forward solely out of stubbornness. Appearing to be in control isn’t worth suppressing your emotions or ignoring your intuition. The path to success is available to you, but you have to choose it and move in that direction."

If you are approaching burnout, be encouraged by The Strength card— you have what it takes to reach your goal. Be kind to yourself and others in the process.",

You may be holding back because you don’t want to fail, but refusing to try is a guaranteed path to failure.
