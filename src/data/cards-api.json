Be open to new opportunities and take a moment to set clear intentions before diving in. What do you hope to get out of this? How can you prioritize joy along the way? Don’t worry about finding the perfect approach. If you end up making a mistake, turn it into a learning opportunity and don’t let it discourage you from continuing on your journey. Try something new, no matter how small, and see where it leads you.",

Are you ignoring advice because you (subconsciously) don’t want to be talked out of something? Are you afraid of failure or of being seen as “foolish” by others? Take time to connect with your inner child. What does that inner child need to feel safe and confident enough to take a risk?

Like The Magician, you have all the tools you need at your fingertips and are excited to move forward. First, you need a clear plan of action. Focus on the “why” just as much as the “what.” Remembering why you want something is a helpful motivator. Ask yourself: if you could have or do anything, what would it be and why? Are there steps you can take toward manifesting it?",

Consider the “why” as well as the “what.” When you pursue a path for the wrong reason, it’s hard to find joy in what you do.

That’s not to say you can’t factor in logical reasoning; just make sure your intuition has a seat at the table. Just as The High Priestess hangs a veil between the physical and spiritual realms, you are encouraged to set boundaries around engaging with the subconscious. This is especially relevant when others ask you to hold space for their feelings and traumas. Engaging with spirituality opens up pathways that can feel uncomfortable, but being uncomfortable isn’t always a bad thing.",

Where is there a sense of imbalance in your life? It may feel uncomfortable to ask yourself these questions, so go as slowly as you need to. Be gentle with yourself.

Traditional interpretations of The Empress refer to a mother figure. Motherhood can take many forms and is not limited to any one gender. How do you care for others, and how do your loved ones care for you?",

If you are feeling stifled in any way, consider your relationships. Have you become overly dependent on someone, or made someone dependent on you? It may be time to create space between you and that person. Rather than a person, there may be a project or responsibility that is taking up too much space in your mind, leaving no time or energy for things that bring you joy. Focus on your relationship with yourself— engage your senses and nurture your creativity. Remember not to neglect yourself when you show up for others.",

They know that leadership does not require maintaining control over others, and that power must be used responsibly and benevolently. If you have privilege afforded to you by patriarchy, institutional racism, or other systems of oppression, consider how you can use your power to dismantle those systems and lift up affected individuals. Less privileged folks are encouraged to channel The Emperor’s “protector” role, whether that means protecting fellow community members, themselves, or their inner child.",
      "meaning_rev": "When you’re feeling vulnerable or disenfranchised, The Emperor reminds you to speak up for yourself. Standing up to authority isn’t always easy and can even be dangerous for some people, so make an assessment of your own safety and act accordingly. It’s also worth considering whether you are the one abusing power. Is a rigid worldview or bias holding you back? Remember that power is not a zero-sum game. You can exercise your leadership skills while nurturing the same in others. If you are feeling hesitant to take a leadership position, ask yourself what’s holding you back.

The Hierophant represents the spiritual (not necessarily religious) teachings and beliefs that are passed down through generations. They remind us to take stock of those beliefs, keep what serves us, and let go of the rest. Form your own code of ethics and act accordingly while considering the example you are setting for others.",
      "meaning_rev": "Consider your current circumstances (your job, friendships, romantic relationships, familial ties and responsibilities, etc.) and ask yourself whether they reflect your values. If you’re not clear on what those values are, dedicate some time to figuring it out. You might turn to a mentor or trusted elder for advice, but remember that you are the expert on your life. Live authentically rather than seeking external validation. You can honor your ancestors while forging your own path— doing what is right for you is not a betrayal of your family or your community.",

Relationships, however, are a kind of decision: love of any kind must be consciously created and nurtured rather than treated as something that will “just happen” and then sustain itself. Like relationships, decision-making should come from a place of intentionality, honesty (with yourself and others!), and accountability. Listen to your values and desires rather than what you think you “should” want or believe. Take time to give the situation the consideration it deserves.",
      "meaning_rev": "You may feel like you’re being pulled in opposite directions— forced to choose between your head and your heart, your career or your family, or perhaps a romantic relationship is pulling time and focus away from your friendships. The Lovers in reverse is a reminder to restore balance to all aspects of your life. Ensure there is equal give and take in your relationships, and remember to cultivate your relationship with yourself. Show compassion to yourself, even the parts that make you feel uneasy or ashamed. Our perceived shortcomings are often coping mechanisms for needs that have gone unmet. How can you move toward getting those needs met?",

It is not enough to want something; you need to move toward your goals. If your chariot is made of stone, you may not be able to move as fast as you’d like, but that slowness gives you a chance to focus on your next move so you can be sure it’s the right one. Have faith in yourself, stand up for what you believe in, and you’ll triumph over any obstacles that get in your way.",

If you are approaching burnout, be encouraged by The Strength card— you have what it takes to reach your goal. Be kind to yourself and others in the process.",

You may be holding back because you don’t want to fail, but refusing to try is a guaranteed path to failure.

Maybe you find yourself isolated from your friends and loved ones. Take time for some quiet contemplation, whether it comes in the form of mediation, journaling, or a solitary walk through nature. Know that you have inner wisdom while remaining open to advice from others. Seek out a mentor, someone you look up to, or a therapist if that is available to you.

You may be left with an empty scale like the figure in the card, but you can be intentional about what you add.
